# addOne

#add one

The exercise is really just a simple addition of 1 to each digit.
So if you have a number like 3967, the solution would be 4078. 
Notice that after 9 is 0. Pretty straight forward, huh?

In great detail Kahneman (btw. winner of the 2002 Nobel price in economics)
outlines the two apparent systems of our mind, notably system 1 and 2. 
System 1 being the primal, quickly thinking part, which helps us recognize facial expressions, 
spatial dimensions, etc. and system 2 (the cognitive, deliberately thinking part)
which kicks into gear when we're supposed to tackle more difficult tasks such as solving equations or other mental tasks. 
If you want to know more, AsapSCIENCE made a nice video explaining the two systems in detail [1] or read the actual book.
